So in a couple of days I'm going to leave my job that I had for 15 years. Exciting times! What I'm going to do next doesn't have much to do with web development - it might not have much to do with development at all for a while. So to keep me from becoming lazy I decided to start a blog, writing about the development and techie things I'm doing in my free time.

There are already a couple of projects in my head that I'm planning to work on in the next months - mainly experiments with deep learning and data science stuff. I lately fell in love with python and [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) so you can expect a lot of python and machine learning posts. And of course since I will continue to maintain the web pages of [Katrin and Sandra](http://www.katrinandsandra.de) I will probably also write some articles about WordPress and what we're working in over there.

That's it for now. At least the start page is not empty any more ;) Stay tuned for more!
